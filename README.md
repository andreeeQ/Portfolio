# Tailwind + Vite + React Starter Kit

This is a starter kit for building web applications using Tailwind CSS, Vite, and React. It provides a basic setup with all the necessary configuration and dependencies to help you quickly start your web development project.

## Features

- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **Vite:** A fast build tooling framework that serves your code in a lightning-fast development server with hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   This will start the development server and open your application in the default browser. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reloaded in the browser.

5. Build for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

   This command will generate an optimized production build of your application in the `dist` directory.

6. Deploy your application:

   After building your application, you can deploy it to a hosting provider of your choice. The contents of the `dist` directory should be deployed.

## Project Structure

The project structure is set up as follows:

- `public`: Contains the HTML template and other static files.
- `src`: Contains the source code for your application.
  - `components`: Place your React components here.
  - `styles`: Place your custom CSS or SCSS files here.
  - `App.js`: The root component of your React application.
  - `index.js`: The entry point of your application.

## Customization

Feel free to customize this starter kit according to your project requirements. You can modify the configuration files, add additional dependencies, or change the project structure as needed.
